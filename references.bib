abstract="The European Data Portal (EDP) is a central access point for metadata of Open Data published by public authorities in Europe and acquires data from more than 70 national data providers. The platform is a starting point in adopting the Linked Data specification DCAT-AP, aiming to increase interoperability and accessibility of Open Data. In this paper, we present the design of the central data management components of the platform, responsible for metadata storage, data harvesting and quality assessment. The core component is based on CKAN, which is extended by the support for native Linked Data replication to a triplestore to ensure legacy compatibility and the support for DCAT-AP. Regular data harvesting and the creation of detailed quality reports are performed by custom components adressing the requirements of DCAT-AP. The EDP is well on track to become the core platform for European Open Data and fostered the acceptance of DCAT-AP. Our platform is available here: https://www.europeandataportal.eu.",

    abstract = { In Europe, an open government data ecosystem is being developed. This ecosystem is implemented using various technologies and platforms. In fact, the use of a common metadata standard for describing datasets and open data portals, i.e., the DCAT-AP specification, appears as the lingua franca that connects an, otherwise, fragmented environment. In this context, the standard-based consolidation of open data promotes the subsidiarity principle, allowing open data portal owners to choose platforms and internal representations based on their specific requirements. However, the portal owners must provide an export with DCAT-AP compliant metadata about the dataset they store. In this paper we provide a detailed study of how the DCAT-AP specification is used in practice, both at the national and the European level. Consequently, we also identify issues, challenges, and opportunities for improvements that can be used as input for the next revision cycle of the standard. Essentially, our goal is to contribute towards the enrichment of a growing and promising European open data ecosystem. }

abstract = {Since it can effectively address the problem of sparsity and cold start of collaborative filtering, knowledge graph (KG) is widely studied and employed as side information in the field of recommender systems. However, most of existing KG-based recommendation methods mainly focus on how to effectively encode the knowledge associations in KG, without highlighting the crucial collaborative signals which are latent in user-item interactions. As such, the learned embeddings underutilize the two kinds of pivotal information and are insufficient to effectively represent the latent semantics of users and items in vector space.In this paper, we propose a novel method named Collaborative Knowledge-aware Attentive Network (CKAN) which explicitly encodes the collaborative signals by collaboration propagation and proposes a natural way of combining collaborative signals with knowledge associations together. Specifically, CKAN employs a heterogeneous propagation strategy to explicitly encode both kinds of information, and applies a knowledge-aware attention mechanism to discriminate the contribution of different knowledge-based neighbors. Compared with other KG-based methods, CKAN provides a brand-new idea of combining collaborative information with knowledge information together. We apply the proposed model on four real-world datasets, and the empirical results demonstrate that CKAN significantly outperforms several compelling state-of-the-art baselines.},
